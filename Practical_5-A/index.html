        <p>
            The department of physics was established in 1960 with Pre-Degree, F.Y. and Second year courses. Afterword in 1980 B.Sc. Degree course was started with an intake capacity of only 12 students. At present 17 students are enrolled for their B.Sc. Physics degree. The department has started M.Sc. Course in Physics (Solid State Physics) since 2013. We have started this course so as to develop it as an advanced center of Solid State Physics. This year 316 students registered for B.Sc. Part I, 107 students enrolled their names for B.Sc. Part II, 27 students enrolled their B.Sc. degree, 19 students registered for M.Sc. Part I and 20 students enrolled for M.Sc. Part II.

The faculty has published around 60 research papers in the International journals and in the proceedings of International/ National/ State and regional level conferences, workshops, Seminars, Symposia etc. Two research projects funded by UGC were completed by former Head department of physics Dr. N.
